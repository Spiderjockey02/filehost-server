      <h4 align=center>Terms and Conditions</h4>
      <p>Thanks for using <%= companyName%>! Our mission is to create a more enlightened way of working by providing an intuitive, unified platform to keep your content safe and
        accessible while helping you and those you work with stay coordinated and in sync. These terms of service ("Terms") cover your use and access to our services,
        client software and websites ("Services"). If you reside outside of the United States of America, Canada and Mexico ("North America") your agreement is with
        <%= companyName%> International Unlimited Company. If you reside in North America your agreement is with <%= companyName%>, Inc. Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect and
        use your information while our Acceptable Use Policy outlines your responsibilities when using our Services. By using our Services, you’re agreeing to be bound
        by these Terms, our Privacy Policy, and Acceptable Use Policy.
      </p>
      <h6>Your Stuff & Your Permissions</h6>
      <p>When you use our Services, you provide us with things like your files, content, messages, contacts, and so on ("Your Stuff"). Your Stuff is yours.
        These Terms don’t give us any rights to Your Stuff except for the limited rights that enable us to offer the Services.
      </p>
      <p>We need your permission to do things like hosting Your Stuff, backing it up, and sharing it when you ask us to.
        Our Services also provide you with features like commenting, sharing, searching, image thumbnails, document previews, optical character recognition (OCR),
        easy sorting and organization, and personalization to help reduce busywork. To provide these and other features, <%= companyName%> accesses, stores, and scans Your Stuff.
        You give us permission to do those things, and this permission extends to our affiliates and trusted third parties we work with.
      </p>
      <h6>Your Responsibilities</h6>
      <p>Your use of our Services must comply with our Acceptable Use Policy. Content in the Services may be protected by others’ intellectual property rights.
        Please don’t copy, upload, download, or share content unless you have the right to do so.
      </p>
      <p><%= companyName%> may review your conduct and content for compliance with these Terms and our Acceptable Use Policy. We aren’t responsible for the content people post
        and share via the Services.
      </p>
      <p>Help us keep Your Stuff protected. Safeguard your password to the Services, and keep your account information current.
        Don’t share your account credentials or give others access to your account.
      </p>
      <p>You may use our Services only as permitted by applicable law, including export control laws and regulations.
        Finally, to use our Services, you must be at least 13 (or older, depending on where you live).
      </p>
      <h6>Software</h6>
      <p>Some of our Services allow you to download client software ("Software") which may update automatically. So long as you comply with these Terms,
        we give you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the Software, solely to access the Services. To the extent any component of
        the Software may be offered under an open source license, we’ll make that license available to you and the provisions of that license may expressly override
        some of these Terms. Unless the following restrictions are prohibited by law, you agree not to reverse engineer or decompile the Services, attempt to do so,
        or assist anyone in doing so.
      </p>
      <h6>Beta Services</h6>
      <p>We sometimes release products and features that we’re still testing and evaluating ("Beta Services"). Beta Services are labeled "alpha", "beta", "preview",
        "early access", or "evaluation" (or with words or phrases with similar meanings) and may not be as reliable as <%= companyName%>"s other services. Beta Services are made
        available so that we can collect user feedback, and by using our Beta Services, you agree that we may contact you to collect such feedback.
      </p>
      <p>Beta Services are confidential until official launch. If you use any Beta Services, you agree not to disclose any information about those Services to anyone else without our permission.</p>
      <h6>Our Stuff</h6>
      <p>The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other US and foreign laws. These Terms don’t grant you any right, title, or interest in the Services,
        others’ content in the Services, <%= companyName%> trademarks, logos and other brand features. We welcome feedback, but note that we may use comments or suggestions without any obligation to you.
      </p>
      <h6>Copyright</h6>
      <p>We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement if they comply with the law, and such notices
        should be reported using our Copyright Policy. We reserve the right to delete or disable content alleged to be infringing and terminate accounts of repeat infringers.
        Our designated agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement on the Services is:</p>

      </p>
      <h6>Paid Accounts</h6>
      <p>Billing. You can increase your storage space and add paid features to your account (turning your account into a “Paid Account”). We’ll automatically bill you from the date
        you convert to a Paid Account and on each periodic renewal until cancellation. If you’re on an annual plan, we’ll send you a notice email reminding you that your plan is
        about to renew within a reasonable period of time prior to the renewal date. You’re responsible for all applicable taxes, and we’ll charge tax when required to do so.
        Some countries have mandatory local laws regarding your cancellation rights, and this paragraph doesn’t override these laws.
      </p>
      <p>Cancellation. You may cancel your <%= companyName%> Paid Account at any time. Refunds are only issued if required by law. For example, users living in the European Union have
        the right to cancel their Paid Account subscriptions within 14 days of signing up for, upgrading to, or renewing a Paid Account by clicking here.
      </p>
      <p>Downgrades. Your Paid Account will remain in effect until it's cancelled or terminated under these Terms. If you don’t pay for your Paid Account on time, we reserve
        the right to suspend it or remove Paid Account features.
      </p>
      <p>Changes. We may change the fees in effect on renewal of your subscription, to reflect factors such as changes to our product offerings, changes to our business, or changes
        in economic conditions. We’ll give you no less than 30 days’ advance notice of these changes via a message to the email address associated with your account and you’ll have
        the opportunity to cancel your subscription before the new fee comes into effect.
      </p>
      <h6><%= companyName%> Business Teams</h6>
      <p>Email address. If you sign up for a <%= companyName%> account with an email address provisioned by your organization, your organization may be able to block your use of <%= companyName%>
        until you transition to an account on a <%= companyName%> Business or Education team (collectively, “<%= companyName%> Business Team”) or you associate your <%= companyName%> account with a personal email address.
      </p>
      <p>Using <%= companyName%> Business Teams. If you join a <%= companyName%> Business Team, you must use it in compliance with your organization’s terms and policies. Please note that <%= companyName%>
        Business Team accounts are subject to your organization's control. Your administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove information in or from your
        <%= companyName%> Business Team account. They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to a <%= companyName%> Business Team account. If you convert an existing <%= companyName%> account
        into part of a <%= companyName%> Business Team, your administrators may prevent you from later disassociating your account from the <%= companyName%> Business Team.
      </p>
      <h6>Termination</h6>
      <p>You’re free to stop using our Services at any time. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Services with notice to you if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>you’re in breach of these Terms,</li>
        <li>your use of the Services would cause a real risk of harm or loss to us or other users, or</li>
        <li>you don’t have a Paid Account and haven't accessed our Services for 12 consecutive months.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice via the email address associated with your account to remedy the activity that prompted us to contact you and give you
        the opportunity to export Your Stuff from our Services. If after such notice you fail to take the steps we ask of you, we’ll terminate or suspend your access to the Services.
      </p>
      <p>We won’t provide notice before termination where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>you’re in material breach of these Terms,</li>
        <li>doing so would cause us legal liability or compromise our ability to provide the Services to our other users, or</li>
        <li>we're prohibited from doing so by law.</li>
      </ul>
      <h6>Discontinuation of Services</h6>
      <p>We may decide to discontinue the Services in response to exceptional unforeseen circumstances, events beyond <%= companyName%>’s control (for example a natural disaster, fire, or explosion),
        or to comply with a legal requirement. If we do so, we’ll give you reasonable prior notice so that you can export Your Stuff from our systems (we will give you no less than
        30 days’ notice where possible under the circumstances). If we discontinue the Services in this way before the end of any fixed or minimum term you have paid us for, we’ll refund
        the portion of the fees you have pre-paid but haven't received Services for.
      </p>
      <h6>Services “AS IS”</h6>
      <p>We strive to provide great Services, but there are certain things that we can't guarantee. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DROPBOX AND ITS AFFILIATES,
        SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF
        MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Some places don’t allow the disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.
        For example, these disclaimers do not override the legal protections, including statutory warranties, granted to consumers by EU law.
      </p>
      <h6>Limitation of Liability</h6>
      <p>WE DON’T EXCLUDE OR LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU WHERE IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL TO DO SO—THIS INCLUDES ANY LIABILITY FOR DROPBOX’S OR ITS AFFILIATES’ FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT
        MISREPRESENTATION IN PROVIDING THE SERVICES. IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF EXCLUSIONS AREN’T ALLOWED, WE'RE RESPONSIBLE TO YOU ONLY FOR LOSSES AND DAMAGES
        THAT ARE A REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO USE REASONABLE CARE AND SKILL OR OUR BREACH OF OUR CONTRACT WITH YOU. THIS PARAGRAPH DOESN’T AFFECT CONSUMER
        RIGHTS THAT CAN'T BE WAIVED OR LIMITED BY ANY CONTRACT OR AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE AN EU OR UK CONSUMER, THESE TERMS DO NOT EXCLUDE DROPBOX’S LIABILITY FOR LOSSES AND
        DAMAGES THAT ARE A RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO USE REASONABLE CARE AND SKILL IN PROVIDING THE SERVICES OR OF OUR BREACH OF OUR CONTRACT WITH YOU, AS LONG AS THOSE LOSSES
        AND DAMAGES ARE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.
      </p>
      <p>IN COUNTRIES WHERE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ARE ALLOWED, DROPBOX, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS WON’T BE LIABLE FOR:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR</li>
        <li>ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>THESE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT DROPBOX OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
      </p>
      <p>IF YOU USE THE SERVICES FOR ANY COMMERCIAL, BUSINESS, OR RE-SALE PURPOSE, DROPBOX, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFIT,
        LOSS OF BUSINESS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY. DROPBOX AND ITS AFFILIATES AREN’T RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE SERVICES.
      </p>
      <p>OTHER THAN FOR THE TYPES OF LIABILITY WE CANNOT LIMIT BY LAW (AS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION), WE LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU TO THE GREATER OF $20 USD OR 100% OF ANY AMOUNT YOU'VE PAID
        UNDER YOUR CURRENT SERVICE PLAN WITH DROPBOX. THIS PROVISION DOES NOT APPLY TO EU CONSUMERS WHERE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
      </p>
      <h6>Resolving Disputes</h6>
      <p>Let’s Try to Sort Things Out First. We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against <%= companyName%>, you agree to try to resolve the dispute
        informally by contacting dispute-notice@dropbox.com. We’ll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of submission,
        you or <%= companyName%> may bring a formal proceeding. If you reside in the EU, the European Commission provides for an online dispute resolution platform, which you can access
        here: https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr.
      </p>
      <p>Judicial Forum for Disputes. You and <%= companyName%> agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to these Terms or the Services will be brought in the federal or state
        courts of San Francisco County, California, subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions below. Both you and <%= companyName%> consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts.
        If you reside in a country (for example, a member state of the European Union) with laws that give consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts, this paragraph
        doesn’t affect those requirements.
      </p>
      <h6>Controlling Law</h6>
      <p>These Terms will be governed by California law except for its conflicts of laws principles. However, some countries (including those in the European Union) have laws that require
        agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer's country. This paragraph doesn’t override those laws.</p>
      <h6>Entire Agreement</h6>
      <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and <%= companyName%> with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous
        agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.
      </p>
      <h6>Waiver, Severability & Assignment</h6>
      <p><%= companyName%>’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain
        in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such
        attempt will be void. <%= companyName%> may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.
      </p>
      <h6>Modifications</h6>
      <p>We may revise these Terms from time to time to better reflect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>changes to the law,</li>
        <li>new regulatory requirements, or</li>
        <li>improvements or enhancements made to our Services.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If an update affects your use of the Services or your legal rights as a user of our Services, we’ll notify you prior to the update's effective date by sending an email to the
        email address associated with your account or via an in-product notification. These updated terms will be effective no less than 30 days from when we notify you.
      </p>
      <p>If you don’t agree to the updates we make, please cancel your account before they become effective. Where applicable, we’ll offer you a prorated refund based on the amounts
        you have prepaid for Services and your account cancellation date. By continuing to use or access the Services after the updates come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
